//  Explain the concept of type coercion in JavaScript. Provide an example of implicit type coercion.

// Type coercion in JavaScript refers to the automaic conversion of one data type to another. 
// JavaScript is a loosely type (dynamic) language ; meaning it automatically
//  converts values between types when necessary; such as when performing operations with different data types.

// Implicit type coercion.
//  This happens when JavaScript automatically converts a value from one type to
//  another withour the programmer needing to specify it.
let result ='5' + 10;
console.log(result)
