// Define and differentiate between mutable and immutable data types in JavaScript, providing one example for each.

// 1. Mutable Data Types
// A mutable data type allows the value of an object or data structure to be changed after its creation.
//  This means you can modify its properties, elements, or contents.
// Example: Objects and Arrays are mutable in JavaScript
// .Example of Mutable Data Type (Array):
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr[0] = 10;  
console.log(arr);

//2. Immutable Data Types
// An immutable data type, once created, cannot be changed. Any operation that attempts to change the value of an immutable data type actually results in a new value being created.
// Example: Strings and Numbers are immutable in JavaScript.
// Example of Immutable Data Type (String):
let str = "Hello";
str[0] = "h";  
console.log(str);
